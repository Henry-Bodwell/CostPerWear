## Project Thesis
I would like to create a website that allows the following behavior.
- Importing Clothing items
	- Each Item will have a name
	- Clothing will have tag data, { Type (Top, Bottom, Shoe, accessory, Full body), Category (Short sleeve, Blouse, Sandal), Material, Color, brand, Environment Multi select (Gym, Office, Bar, Casual, House, Formal), Fit (Loose, Normal, Fitted, Tight), MISC Tags}
	- Cost Data
	- Image of the clothing Item
- Track the number of wears, easy to increment
- Analysis, based on the tags what are the users preferred brands and categories, why does the user wear what they do? what are the users motivators? How can we relay that information to encourage smart purchases?
	- Sarah would like a note section on the clothes
	- Would like to track the Frequency of wears since purchase
- Recommendations, recommend clothes in closet that used to be worn a lot and aren't, or don't get a lot of play to try and encourage use of purchases. In the future if the data analysis is strong build a recommendation algo for new clothes
- Outfits enable a user to enter common outfits for ease of tracking. if i wear this shirt this pant and jacket regularly I don't want to increment all of those separately


### Personal Goals
I would like to use a new language to write this project -- Go or Rust? since a website maybe JavaScript or React. Will need to [[Resources |research]].

I would like to host this website on our network to start. in the future I can look into spinning up a vm and attaching it into a DMZ external VLAN to allow for external access 

I want the user interface to be nice enough so that Sarah will use it over a basic excel spreadsheet.

I want to try and document this project well to turn it into something interesting I can talk about.

I will be active in updating this on GitHub and it will be public so I can flex
